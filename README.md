[> Intro
--------
LiteHelloWorld is a Litex core template repository that can be used to quick start
a custom core design.

LiteHelloWorld is part of LiteX libraries whose aims are to lower entry level of
complex FPGA cores by providing simple, elegant and efficient implementations
of components used in today's SoC such as Ethernet, SATA, PCIe, SDRAM Controller...

Using Migen to describe the HDL allows the core to be highly and easily configurable.

LiteHelloWorld can be used as LiteX library or can be integrated with your standard
design flow by generating the verilog rtl that you will use as a standard core.

[> Getting started
------------------
1. Install Python 3.6+ and FPGA vendor's development tools.
2. Install LiteX and the cores by following the LiteX's wiki [installation guide](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/Installation).
3. FIXME: INSTALL NEEDED??
./setup.py develop --user

[> Tests
--------
Unit tests are available in ./test/.
To run all the unit tests:
```sh
$ ./setup.py test
```

Tests can also be run individually:
```sh
$ python3 -m unittest test.test_name
```

[> License
----------
Custom licence to be indicated here.


[> Support and consulting
-------------------------
We love open-source hardware and like sharing our designs with others.

If you would like to know more about LiteHelloWorld or if you are already a happy
user and would like to extend it for your needs, EnjoyDigital can provide standard
commercial support as well as consulting services.

So feel free to contact us, we'd love to work with you! (and eventually shorten
the list of the possible improvements :)
